# Voice

## Who is talking?

Our written voice embodies certain characteristics that never change and reflects our @Decent Values. Our written voice will communicate our collective persona, our attitude about our work, and our client's needs. It is our unique worldview and will guide our word choices.

*When writing in Decent's voice,*

1. **Consider Yourself A Friendly Translator of Tech**
In most circumstances, we will be in the position of educator and expert. Be cognizant of your audience's familiarity with the topic at hand and adjust accordingly. When discussing complex topics, use simple terms. Value clarity above all. Assume a baseline understanding should be established before moving deeper. Never speak above your audience or make them feel inferior, use passion to educate in an approachable way.
2. **Be Precise**
Being exact is very important to technologists. Be detail-oriented and do your homework. No short-cuts or “hand-wavey” explanations are allowed. We need to assume any and all writing will be critiqued by an equally skilled peer.
3. **Spark Fascination**
Tap into the respectful spirit of awe, wonder, and humility that encircle advanced technology and its potential. Our work is important and powerful, and we stand on the shoulders of giants to accomplish it.
4. **Prophesize the Future**
Describe emerging technology with optimistic confidence. Point out the problems solved and explain the solutions provided. A universe in which technology empowers and unites individuals is in development, but not everyone can see it yet. Encourage hope and revelation by rebuilding trust in technology.

# Tone

## How are they talking?

If the **voice is "who**" is talking, then the **tone is "how"** they are talking.

In general, Decent's **tone is informal yet precise**, with the **highest priority given to plain and simple communication** of a message. Our primary objective is to educate and lead.

We encourage the **sprinkling of wit** if it is appropriate and comes naturally to you. Re-read what you have written to be sure the message isn't muddled. Always **prioritize clear communication** over being clever and edit accordingly.

**Consider the context** of your project and/or the headspace of your audience to alter your tone. For example, the initial email to a founder prospect will have a slightly more formal tone than a Decent social media post.

**Technical content can be very heavy to read** and comprehend. We can offset this with a lighter, conversational tone versus a dry or flat tone.
